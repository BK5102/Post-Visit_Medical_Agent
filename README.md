# Post-Visit Medical Agent

## rough outline of what agent does (need to modify later):

Based on insights, agent must perform tasks such as ordering meds, 
groceries, suggest healthy meals, recommend exercises with online links, set alarms/reminders, interface with APIs 

--- Amazon Fresh/Instacart API, Google Calendar API, Apple Health or 
Fitbit API

Input: Doctor note / test result
Output:
1. Explains post-visit medical notes or test results (GenAI-based)
2. Understands prescribed medications, lifestyle advice, and clinical suggestions. Extracts key health tasks (meds, diet, follow-ups)
3. Performs tasks to assist the patient in follow-through actions (Agent behavior)
	Book calendar reminders or follow-up visits

	Order groceries/meds via Instacart or pharmacy API
